            <br>
            CATEGORY 2: PERFORMANCE COOKIES <br>
            These cookies collect anonymous information on how you use our Website.

The cookies are usually placed by third party advertising networks. They remember the websites you visit, and that information is shared with other parties such as advertisers. For example, we use third party companies to provide you with more personalized adverts when visiting other websites. You may opt-in to these cookies using your browser settings. <br>
            <br>
            CATEGORY 5: SOCIAL MEDIA COOKIES <br>

            <br>
            <b><i>Access. </i></b>You have the right to know whether we process personal data about you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with (including the categories of personal data we share with businesses for their direct marketing uses and the names and addresses of those businesses). Please note that in&nbsp;“Profile”&nbsp;section you can see information about you, namely your account details (such as name, email, phone number, the addresses you use for billing and shipping, your order history and shopping preferences). <br>
            <br>
            You can also request a copy of your information. If you require more than one copy of the data, we hold about you, we may charge a reasonable administration fee. <br>
            <br>
            We may not provide you with certain personal data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person) or where another exemption applies. <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>Portability. </i></b>You have the right to receive a subset of the personal data we collect from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such personal data to another party. The relevant subset of personal data is data that you provide us with your consent or for the purposes of performing our contract with you. If you wish for us to transfer the personal data to another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the personal data or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property). <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>Correction.</i></b> You have the right to correct any personal data held about you that is inaccurate. You can edit your personal information in&nbsp;“Profile”&nbsp;settings. You can also request the correction by emailing us. Please note that in some cases we can ask you to explain in detail why you believe the personal data we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required. Please note that whilst we assess whether the personal data, we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the applicable data as described below. <br>
            <br>
            <i><b>Erasure. </b></i>You may request that we erase the personal data we hold about you in the certain circumstances. Please scroll down to know what those are: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>You believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold the personal data we hold about you.</li>
                <li>We are processing the personal data we hold about you on the basis of your consent, and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no other ground under which we can process the personal data.</li>
                <li>We are processing the personal data we hold about you based on our legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is an overriding interest for us to retain such personal data.</li>
                <li>You no longer wish us to use the personal data we hold about you to send you promotions and special offers.</li>
                <li>You believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.</li>
            </ul>
            Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing the data whilst we consider your request as described below. <br>
            <br>
            Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. Please note, however, that we may retain the personal data if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. <br>
            <br>
            Where you have requested that we erase data that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the data or providing links to the data to erase the data too.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
            <b><i>Restriction of Processing to Storage Only.</i></b>&nbsp;You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal data, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (e.g. for the defense of legal claims or for another’s protection). The cases where you may request, we stop processing and just store the personal data we hold about you are: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>You believe the personal data is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify your claim. </li>
                <li>We wish to erase the personal data as the processing we are doing is unlawful, but you want us to retain the personal data for storage but not further process it. </li>
                <li>We wish to erase the personal data as it is no longer necessary for our purposes, but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. </li>
                <li>You have objected to us processing personal data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal data whilst we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal data.</li>
            </ul>
