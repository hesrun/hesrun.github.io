                        The name of Daniel Roth, a remarkable watchmaker and founder of an equally remarkable brand,
                        means a
                        great deal to
                        modern watchmaking. At the height of his career in the second half of the 1990s, he was very
                        loud,
                        then,
                        after the brand
                        ceased operations, he largely disappeared from the limelight of the watchmaking community,
                        making
                        the
                        watches of the
                        brand he founded a classic collector’s item. And not just because the subject is closed, as

                        Roth
                        brand watches
                        have been discontinued, but mainly because of the unique style the master craftsman developed,
                        the
                        constellation of
                        great movements he created and the first-class workmanship we find in Daniel Roth brand watches.

                        <p>
                            But let’s start from the beginning. Daniel Roth comes from a family of watchmakers in Nice,
                            France, and he decided to
                            become a watchmaker himself. After completing his training at a watchmaking school, he
                            nevertheless went to perhaps the
                            best region for this craft – the Swiss Vallée de Joux, which is rightly called the Valley of
                            Watchmakers. After working
                            for Jaeger-LeCoultre and seven years at Audemars Piguet, he took a risky gamble in 1973: he
                            accepted an offer from
                            Parisian jewelers Jeanque and Pierre Chaumet to work for them on the revival of the Breguet
                            brand. Breguet was not in
                            the best of shape at the time and was living off a single store in Paris. Looking back
                            today, many decades later, at
                            what the brand has become, it is clear that Daniel Roth’s role was extremely important, even
                            though half a century has
                            passed since then. It is perhaps to him that the brand owes its understanding of the
                            importance of the unique Empire
                            style that the founder of the Breguet brand once created. Daniel Roth brought this style
                            together and essentially
                            created the brand’s DNA with an Empire-style case, a fluted caseband, ‘Pomme de Breguet’
                            hands and a guilloché dial –
                            what we call the “Breguet style”.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Daniel Roth, together with François Bodet, the then General Director of Breguet from 1972 to
                            1987, and Louis-Maurice
                            Caillet, a prototypist of the brand, created the fundamental designs that still characterize
                            the style of the brand
                            today – these certainly include models such as the Quantième Perpétuel Ref. 3050, Réserve de
                            Marche Phase de Lune Ref.
                            3130, Chronograph Ref. 3230, Day-Date Moonphase Ref. 3330 and Tourbillon Ref. 3350.

                            It seems as though Mr. Daniel Roth was a very capable apprentice to Abraham-Louis Breguet,
                            one of the greatest
                            watchmakers in the history of watchmaking. In 1987, when Chaumet’s core business fell victim
                            to the fall in diamond
                            prices and the Breguet brand was taken over by the Bahraini company Investcorp, Daniel Roth
                            began to think about
                            creating his own brand. It is interesting to note that he initially patented two versions of
                            the brand name in 1987: D.
                            Roth and Roth. A year later, in 1988, he seemed to have finally settled on the name of his
                            own brand when he patented
                            his full name, Daniel Roth. He launched his brand in 1988 with the financial backing of
                            Siber Hegner, an international
                            distribution and marketing group based in Zurich with deep roots in the Asia-Pacific region
                            (now known as DKSH, or
                            Diethelm Keller Siber Hegner).

                    When Mr. Roth founded his own brand, he benefited greatly from his successful experience with the
                    unique style of the
                    Breguet watch collection. This is clearly evident in the Daniel Roth watches produced from 1989
                    until his departure from
                    the brand he founded in 2001. Looking at many watches from this period, I would say that the Daniel
                    Roth of the 1990s is
                    not a repetition of the Breguet style, but its best innovative interpretation. This also includes
                    how clearly and
                    consistently the design codes of the Daniel Roth watches were defined – entirely in the spirit of
                    Abraham-Louis Breguet.

                                it is a uniquely shaped case with straight sides and a double arch – top and bottom. The
                                style of the case can be
                                described as Empire, with a clearly protruding caseband with a rounded profile and a
                                symmetrical bezel and caseback both
                                also rounded. Obligatory additions are straight, sloping lugs with a rounded upper part
                                and
                                a cylindrical crown with
                                straight knurling. The case design is often referred to as a “double ellipse”, but this
                                definition does not seem to be
                                justified from a historical point of view, nor does it correspond to the shape of the
                                case.
                                Believe me, the geometric
                                figure of the ellipse has nothing to do with the shape of the Daniel Roth case (nor with
                                Patek Philippe’s Golden
                                Ellipse). Rather, the Daniel Roth case is a double-arched case, or a double arcade if
                                Lange
                                had not staked out that

                                there is the guilloché dial, which is predominantly two-tone, with a dark ruthenium
                                coating
                                and a natural white gold
                                tone (as long as Daniel Roth watches had solid white gold dials), a clear departure from
                                the
                                Breguet style, which is
                                predominantly monochrome and silvered. Mr. Roth initially chose two guilloché patterns
                                to
                                decorate the dial: a Ligné,
                                which is strongly associated with early Daniel Roth watches, and a diagonal Clous de
                                Paris,
                                which is also a basic
                                pattern on many Breguet watches.

                        <p class="xl:mr-[250px]">In addition, Mr. Roth’s early watches also feature some unusual design
                            solutions that testify
                            to his keen eye. For
                            example, in the earliest tourbillons of his watches with this complication, and in some
                            other watches created without
                            his involvement, we always find a triple seconds hand, with three blued steel wings of
                            different lengths sliding over
                            three sectoral seconds registers – we find the same in the Tourbillon Suscription of 2024,
                            which was the first watch
                            introduced by the revived brand. This small detail has suddenly become so important that,
                            together with the
                            double-arched case, it is perceived as the brand signature.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="xl:ml-[250px]">
                            Another unique invention by Mr. Roth is the design of the dial of the Tourbillon Ref. 187
                            and 186, namely the part that
                            adjoins the open part with the tourbillon. It looks like bat wings or a symbolic image of a
                            royal robe. It consists of a
                            solid central part with a triple sector of the seconds track and two wave-shaped cartouches
                            (all parts with a
                            meticulously guilloché “filet sauté” contour!), on which the brand logo and the watch number
                            are depicted. The earliest
                            logo seen on a Daniel Roth watch has an extravagant wave shape – it is very bold and
                            amazingly charismatic in design. It
                            definitely took first place in the watch logo competition I just made up.

                            Thanks to these design codes, Daniel Roth watches are instantly recognizable, and this
                            recognizability is reinforced by
                            a very important factor for a true connoisseur and collector – the high class of the
                            movements and the excellent
                            finishing. In general, the DNA of Daniel Roth has proven so strong that even in an
                            incomplete and modified form, it
                            still defines the esthetics of the brand’s collection – until now, when the LVMH Group, the
                            current owner of Daniel
                            Roth, announced plans to relaunch the brand. Fortunately, not from scratch.

                            Unfortunately, Mr. Roth’s excellent taste and ability to design extremely attractive watches
                            could not match his ability
                            to run a profitable business. His period of independence did not last long – as early as
                            1994 he sold the majority of
                            shares in his brand and – unfortunately – his name to the Singaporean retail group The Hour
                            Glass, Daniel Roth’s most
                            important retail partner in the strategically important region of South East Asia. The
                            subsequent global economic crisis
                            of 1998 forced The Hour Glass to rethink its plans for the watch brands it owned, and in
                            2000 Daniel Roth was sold on,
                            along with the Gérald Genta brand, to the Italian Bulgari Group. One of the conditions of
                            the deal was the sale of all
                            one hundred percent of the company shares to the new owner, so since 2000 Daniel Roth no
                            longer owned even a small part
                            of the company he had founded and decided to leave it. Bulgari ran the brand as an
                            independent company for a decade and
                            finally decided to dissolve it in 2010, although the brand’s DNA was still used in the
                            Daniel Roth by Bulgari collection
                            watches for a while.

                        The history of the Daniel Roth brand can be clearly divided into different phases – the classic
                        phase in which Mr. Roth
                        had full control of the brand. Roth had full control of the brand (1989-1994), the phase of The
                        Hour Glass (1994-2000),
                        the Bulgari phase (from 2000 to approx. 2015; in the last part of this period, from approx.
                        2010, Daniel Roth watches
                        were marketed under the Bulgari brand name) and finally the LVMH phase, which began in 2024 with
                        the announcement of the
                        relaunch of the brand and the presentation of the Daniel Roth Tourbillon Suscription, a limited
                        edition of 20 pieces,
                        which is the first and only watch of the revived brand at this time.

                        However, this is not the case with the double-sided tourbillons from the first and second
                        periods.
                        The sports
                        chronographs based on the Zenith El Primero still reflect modern tastes and have not appreciated
                        too
                        much in value. They
                        were clearly the most popular watches of the second period, and the brand has produced many
                        versions, so collectors have
                        plenty of options to find a design to their liking. The Le Sentier Sport, another sports model,
                        is
                        sometimes available
                        with a unique bracelet design with each link mimics the contours of Daniel Roth’s double-arched
                        case. This design,
                        sometimes referred to in the collecting community as the Lego bracelet, was inspired by the
                        experimental bracelets
                        rarely seen on early Daniel Roth watches from the first period, where each link is openworked.
                        The
                        most attractive
                        models are the Le Sentier Sport in steel, but the solid gold models can also be a very good
                        bargain.

                                Despite the repeated change of ownership, the referencing system in the Daniel Roth
                                collection has generally remained
                                consistent, which helps us to understand how the collection developed. The early
                                references
                                seem to have been conceived
                                along the lines of Breguet’s four-digit references – I believe it is quite possible that
                                this system was introduced at
                                Breguet with the active involvement of Mr. Roth. All early Daniel Roth references start
                                with
                                the number 2 – for the
                                Tourbillon Double Face it is Ref. 2187, for the Chronograph Manual it is Ref. 2147, for
                                the
                                Perpetual Calendar Automatic
                                it is Ref. 2117. It is amusing to note that Mr. Roth has a penchant for ending
                                references
                                with the number 7, similar to
                                Breguet watches where the last digit 0 in the reference was replaced by 7 when changing
                                from
                                a solid caseback to an
                                exhibition caseback.

                                be noted that incorrect
                                references sometimes appear in modern publications and even at reputable auction houses,
                                for
                                example in the case of the
                                Tourbillon Single Face Ref. 2186, which is almost always referred to as Ref. 2187, 187

                                After Daniel Roth joined The Hour Glass group, the reference system was changed:

                                Instead of the first digit 2 in the references, the letter C appeared – this is the most
                                common case. We can only
                                speculate about the reason for this decision, so we have to accept it as a given.

                                The third change to the reference system took place after the brand was taken over by
                                the
                                Bulgari Group

                                The first letter of the previous references was removed, leaving a three-digit base to
                                which
                                the letter designation of
                                the generation or design version was added, followed by a two-digit material
                                designation: 10
                                – stainless steel, 40 –
                                yellow gold, 50 – rose gold, 60 – white gold, 70 – platinum. This gave the shortened

                                of the reference the
                                following form, for example: Ref. 196.X.40, and it is in this form that the references
                                are
                                most commonly found in modern
                                publications, while the full reference is longer, for example: Ref. 196.X.40.168.CN.BA.
                                As I
                                am aware of the evolution
                                of references, I will mainly use the latter type of reference with a three-digit base
                                part.

                                The last change in the reference system, which took place in the early 2010s, is a
                                consequence of the end of Daniel Roth
                                as an independent brand. For several years, some models continued to be produced as the
                                Daniel Roth by Bulgari
                                collection, with the Daniel Roth brand name initially appearing on the dials together
                                with
                                the Bulgari name, until the
                                Daniel Roth brand finally disappeared from the dials. Around 2015, Bulgari discontinued
                                the
                                production of watches from
                                the Daniel Roth collection.

                                A notable complexity in examining the development of the Daniel Roth collection is the
                                lack
                                of visible consecutive case
                                numbering, as we find on the watches of many Swiss brands. Such numbering is found on
                                the
                                watches of the third period of
                                the brand’s history and ranges from around 10,000 to 22,000, which corresponds well with
                                current estimates of Daniel
                                Roth’s production volume of around 1,000 pieces per year on average.

                        the brand’s logo has only undergone one significant change. You could call it insignificant
                        as it only affected one
                        letter, but that’s not how I would see it, and I’ll explain why below

                                Mk1, the original version of the logo, which first appeared in 1989, remained largely
                                unchanged until 1999 and even
                                later, apart from minor differences in typography. I believe that Mr. Roth and the brand
                                as a whole did not attach much
                                importance to these minor variations, as the style and spirit remained the same in any
                                case. The Mk1a logo has an
                                unusual wavy outline, which emphasizes the special design of the dial of the Tourbillon
                                Ref. 187 and 186.

                        Thus, the wave-shaped Mk1a logo was followed by the arc-shaped <b>Mk1b</b> logo, which first
                        appeared on the dial of the
                        Chronograph Manual Ref. 2147 in 1990, exactly the same on the Perpetual Calendar Automatic Ref.
                        117 in 1993, and then on

                                of the Daniel Roth case. However,
                                on many models launched before 2000, the brand designers were quite free in the design
                                of the Mk1b logo, both in terms
                                of the width of the letters and the density of their arrangement. There is no clear
                                pattern here, so I will confine

                                form the mirror image of an arch.
                                But that’s not all the differences: the font of this version of the logo is compressed,
                                which is in stark contrast to
                                the wide and rather freely arranged letters of the Mk1b logo.

                        As I have already mentioned, the Mk2 logo differs from the Mk1 logo in only one letter. It is
                        the letter T, which is
                        drawn without serifs instead of with serifs as in the original logo font. Most importantly, the
                        upper stroke of the T
                        has a arched shape – just like the counterweight of the seconds hand on some Daniel Roth
                        watches, especially
                        chronographs, where we find a pair of such hands.

                        An obvious reference to the double-arched shape of the Daniel Roth watch case makes the design
                        coherent and therefore
                        particularly impressive. As far as I could find out, the Mk2 logo first appeared on the rare
                        Moonphase Power Reserve
                        Millenium Edition Ref. 357, which was released in 1999 to celebrate the upcoming year 2000.
                        Interestingly, this edition
                        was produced with the new logo version before the brand was acquired by the Bulgari Group.
                        Normally, it is reasonable to
                        associate the change of corporate identity with the appearance of a new owner, but in this case
                        the change of logo took
                        place beforehand.

                        It is also worth noting that many watches designed before 2000 and produced later bore the Mk1
                        logo well into the 2000s.
                        Some of the most notable examples of the Mk1 logo being used on watches produced in the 2000s
                        include the Ref. 447
                        automatic chronographs.

                        The Mk2 logo has a number of variations that are consistent with versions of the Mk1 logo

                        The single-arched Mk2a logo first appeared on the Millenium Edition Ref. 357 in 1999, while the
                        Mk2b logo in the form of
                        an inverted arch can be found on the Metropolitan Ref. 857, which was introduced in 2000. The
                        double-arched Mk2c logo
                        first appeared on the Tourbillon 8 Jours Double Face Power Reserve Ref. 197.X in 2002. In 2003,
                        the last – straight (for
                        the first time straight logo in a Daniel Roth watch) – Mk2d version of the logo was finally
                        born, which we see on the
                        dial of the Tourbillon Retrograde Date Power Reserve Ref. 196.X.

                        In the development of the new 2024 edition of the Daniel Roth Tourbillon watch, Souscription
                        Tourbillon Ref.
                        DR0011YG-01, the brand has returned to the wave-shaped Mk1a logo. The logo has a slightly
                        different style, so we should
                        call it Mk1a2. I’d like to point out that I find some unfortunate changes in the design of some
                        characters that change
                        the graphic appearance of the original version of the wavy logo. Specifically, the upward curved
                        tail of the R letter,
                        the visually foreshortened A letter, and the overly heavy E letter. When I compare the new Mk1a2
                        logo with the original
                        Mk1a logo, I can’t imagine the reason for these changes, because I don’t think they add any
                        value.
