                            Ref.
                            186 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In 1989, Mr. Roth introduced the first development for his brand – the Tourbillon Double
                            Face
                            Ref. 2187 (C187 or simply
                            187 – see my comments on the reference system above). It’s hardly worth going into this
                            story in
                            detail – there have
                            been many publications about it recently, which you can easily find if you want. I’ll limit
                            myself to a few key points.
                            First, it’s worth noting that, as Mr. Roth reports in his late interview with
                            acollectedman.com,
                            the DR307 caliber of
                            this watch is the same movement that was developed at Nouvelle Lémania for Breguet and is
                            known
                            as the Nouvelle Lémania
                            387. Mr. Roth says he invested in the development in order to be able to use the movement in
                            watches of his own brand.
                            Two conclusions can be drawn from Mr. Roth’s words: First, the development only cost Breguet
                            half as much – not a bad
                            deal for Breguet with a budding independent watchmaker, and second, at the time this project
                            was
                            launched, Mr. Roth was
                            already planning to leave his job at Breguet for his own brand, although he hadn’t even left
                            Breguet yet. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Unlike the Breguet brand, which initially used this caliber without complications in its
                            collection, Mr. Roth gave it an
                            additional module with date and power reserve display, which was unusually placed on the
                            back of
                            the movement. The
                            result is a rare double-sided design: the second dial, designed in the same style as the
                            main
                            dial, and the displays on
                            it are visible through the exhibition caseback. Therefore, unlike the related Breguet
                            Tourbillon
                            Ref. 3350/3357, the
                            Tourbillon Double Face Ref. 187 has the tourbillon open only on the side of the dial. The
                            Tourbillon Double Face Ref.
                            187 is the most common and therefore most popular version of the early Daniel Roth
                            tourbillon.
                            It is available in two
                            main versions of the dial, decorated with either a Ligné guilloché with vertical lines or a
                            diagonally aligned Clous de
                            Paris guilloché. The decoration of the dial on the back is in a similar style. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The basic version has a two-tone dial with a ruthenium-plated part decorated with Ligné
                            guilloché and a part showing the
                            natural color of white gold. We find this version in the special early subscription edition
                            of
                            25 pieces in yellow gold
                            made for the London retailer Asprey and announced in 1989. According to Mr. Roth, this
                            edition
                            helped his business get
                            on its feet. The most striking feature of the watch from this edition is the inscription
                            “Asprey” on the ‘bat wing’ to
                            the left of the tourbillon, which replaces Daniel Roth’s wave-shaped Mk1a logo.

                    The Tourbillon Double Face is magnificent, but Mr. Roth did not limit his imagination to watches
                    with two faces and
                    offered two other versions

                        the Tourbillon Double Face Skeleton Ref. 187S with the skeletonized caliber DR308 (often
                        erroneously
                        referred to as
                        DR307) and openworked dials on both sides, and the Tourbillon Single Face Ref. 186. To avoid
                        confusion, it should be
                        noted that the latter version is usually referred to in modern publications as reference 187
                        (with
                        closed caseback) or
                        187S (with exhibition caseback), which is incorrect, as references 186 and 186S were originally
                        intended for this
                        purpose. It should also be noted that the movement of Ref. 186S is not skeletonized, as one
                        might
                        expect, but a regular
                        movement with a solid mainplate and bridges whose visible parts are decorated with elaborate
                        engravings with floral
                        scroll – or ‘volutes’ – ornaments in baroque style. Unfortunately, there is no logic in the
                        references here, you just
                        have to memorize this feature. The engraved Ref. 186S is sometimes also called “Volutes”.

                            Their circulation probably does not exceed 30-50 pieces (50 is an optimistic estimate),
                            while the circulation of the
                            basic Ligné and Clous de Paris versions is around 300 pieces. The skeletonized Ref. 187S is
                            rarer than the basic 187
                            versions; the production of the 187S will probably not exceed 30 pieces. Among the rarities
                            are certainly the platinum
                            models Ref. 187 and 187S as well as the exotic steel watches from a special series of 20
                            pieces produced by Daniel Roth
                            for the Italian market. Acollectedman.com explains: “These were made at the request of
                            Roberto Carlotti, the distributor
                            for Daniel Roth in Italy.” The list of coveted rarities should also include watches with a
                            salmon-colored dial, although
                            in my opinion the regular yellow gold version with a two-tone Ligné dial has such a strong
                            appeal that it is in no way
                            inferior to the popular salmon-colored version.

                            As for the rarity of certain versions and editions, I would like to note that every early
                            Daniel Roth tourbillon watch,
                            without exception, should be considered a rare, important and valuable collector’s watch
                            whose value will only increase.

                            It is very likely that production of the Ref. 187 was discontinued in 2002 when its
                            successor, the Ref. 197.X, was
                            introduced. Its newly developed DR720 caliber has an impressive power reserve of 8 days –
                            the era of Nouvelle Lémania as
                            a movement supplier in the history of Daniel Roth had thus come to an end.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            This design was the successor to the great Daniel Roth classic, the Ref. 187, with its
                            ‘batwing’ main dial and caseback
                            dial with date and power reserve display. In 2002, when this reference was launched, Daniel
                            Roth, Gérald Genta and their
                            joint production facility in Vallee-de-Joux were already part of the Bulgari Group.
                            Naturally, Bulgari decided from the
                            outset to invest in the development of new movements for both brands (some of which were
                            used in the Bulgari
                            collection), leading to the introduction of a series of new tourbillon movements. The first
                            in this series is the DR720
                            caliber, which allowed the double-sided design similar to the Ref. 187, but with a
                            significantly longer power reserve of
                            up to 8 days. Accordingly, the new Ref. 197 has an 8-day power reserve display in digital
                            format instead of the analog
                            display of the Ref. 187, which is new to the brand’s collection. The ‘batwing’ dial has
                            generally retained its
                            recognizable appearance, albeit with significant changes: The ‘bat wing’ parts are higher
                            and form three symmetrical
                            arcs together with the center section, formed by a triple sectoral sub-dial of small
                            seconds.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The characteristic three-winged small seconds hand is set on the tourbillon axis. For Ref.
                            197, the brand decided to
                            abandon the original Ligné guilloché in favor of the more traditional Lozenge pattern, a
                            sort of Clous de Paris, but
                            alongated in a vertical direction. However, in the final years of production of the Ref.
                            197, the brand also abandoned
                            this guilloché pattern. From 2006, the “new style” was favored – with a high-contrast white
                            dial and large black Roman
                            numerals forming a dynamic image. It seems that with the transition to the “new style”, the
                            DR720 caliber received the
                            new designation DR5300. Unfortunately, it was not possible to find any information in the
                            available sources as to
                            whether this was due to a technical modernization or not. Personally, I am inclined to
                            believe that this is the case.

                            Here Daniel Roth has gone in an avant-garde direction, away from the classics. The hinged
                            case of the Ref. 197 makes it
                            possible to keep the case upright at all times, even when the watch is worn on the wrist, so
                            that the date and the power
                            reserve display are visible. It also transforms the watch into a kind of miniature clock
                            when placed on a table.

                            This reference, which is one of the rarest and most mysterious editions of the brand’s
                            tourbillons, was introduced
                            around 2004. At the time, it was the first Daniel Roth tourbillon in its purest form, i.e.
                            without additional
                            complications. The beautiful name “Régulateur à Tourbillon” clearly refers to the legacy of
                            Abraham-Louis Breguet, the
                            inventor of the tourbillon, who named this complication accordingly in his 1801 patent.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The dial of the classically designed Ref. 198 is decorated with a Lozenge guilloché pattern.
                            However, the black Roman
                            numerals lose their calm character, typical of early Daniel Roth watches, and take on
                            dynamic contours that were
                            previously unusual for the brand’s collection – this appears to be the first sign of a “new
                            style”. As with the Ref.
                            196, there is no characteristic three-winged small seconds hand on the tourbillon. Examples
                            in yellow, rose and white
                            gold have appeared on the market, which, judging by the numbering, most likely belong to a
                            limited edition of 15 pieces.
                            The watch is powered by the hand-wound DR650 caliber, which has not yet appeared in other
                            releases from the brand.

                    This reference was introduced around 2003–2004 and is based on an automatic movement with
                    tourbillon, perpetual calendar
                    and retrograde date. This is a development of the sister brand Gérald Genta, which was carried out
                    in the mid-1990s. For
                    the Ref. 199.Y, this movement was upgraded and given the designation DR740. This reference is the
                    first automatic
                    tourbillon in the Daniel Roth collection and the first watch to combine a perpetual calendar and a
                    tourbillon. The
                    combination of two major complications resulted in a high price for the watch (platinum watches over
                    $200,000), which
                    inevitably affected its low production volume. It is therefore not surprising that the Ref. 199.Y is
                    one of Daniel
                    Roth’s rarest releases. Early examples of the Ref. 199.Y have a serene, classic dial with a Grain de
                    riz guilloché. The
                    dial of the white gold models is two-tone gray and silver, while the platinum models have a two-tone
                    dial with shades of
                    sky blue and silver. The limited edition of 2004 “XV Years”, dedicated to the 15th anniversary of
                    the brand, has a
                    monochrome silver-colored dial with three XV numerals on the small seconds sub-dial. The
                    second-generation models, of
                    which only watches in white gold or platinum are available, have a “New Style” dial, i.e. a dynamic
                    design and large
                    Roman numerals.

                            The hand-wound DR780 caliber with 64-hour power reserve of the Tourbillon Lumière Ref.
                            200.Y is a simplified and
                            skeletonized version of the DR730 caliber first used in the Tourbillon Retrograde Date
                            Ref. 196.X, with the retrograde
                            date omitted and the arrangement of the main train changed. The Tourbillon Lumière was
                            originally launched in 2007 in a
                            limited edition of 50 pieces in rose gold. At that time, the style of the Daniel Roth
                            collection was already strongly
                            influenced by the esthetic preferences of its owners, the Bulgari Group. As Francesco
                            Trapani, the CEO of the Bulgari
                            Group at the time, explained in interviews, Daniel Roth’s style was too classy and dusty
                            for him as a Bulgari man.
                            Perhaps there are few watch connoisseurs who would say “dusty” when it comes to the
                            Tourbillon Double Face Skeleton Ref.
                            187S, Daniel Roth’s first skeletonized tourbillon. But it is clear that the traditional
                            baroque esthetic of this watch
                            does not suit Bulgari’s extravagant, decorative style. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Well, the Tourbillon Lumière Ref. 200.Y is a skeletonized tourbillon by Daniel Roth that
                            is all Bulgari in terms of
                            style and character. Like the case, the openworked mainplate, bridges and ratchet wheel
                            are 18k rose gold, and the
                            signature Daniel Roth “arrow” hands have been given a unique serpentine shape in this
                            edition to make the statement even
                            more impressive. You could say that this is a nod to the Bulgari Serpenti design, or you
                            could link it to Abraham-Louis
                            Breguet’s use of serpentine hands. Either way, the allusion has meaning and
                            significance.

                            only minor changes such as the Bulgari logo at the top of the ‘horseshoe’ on the dial.

                            All four versions of the Tourbillon Lumière are extremely rare on the market, leading to

                            Yes, there is no power reserve indicator on the back of the Ref. 220.Y, but there is a moon
                            phase indicator as well as
                            the classic perpetual calendar indications. The DR5301 caliber of this watch is based on the
                            DR5300 caliber of the late
                            reference 197 (“New Style”), with the date mechanism replaced by a perpetual calendar module
                            and the power reserve
                            indicator moved to the dial on the front. At the same time, the Ref. 220.Y was equipped with
                            the same hinged case as the
                            Ref. 197.

                            gold and platinum have been spotted on the market. This is the last tourbillon developed by
                            the Daniel Roth brand before
                            its withdrawal in 2010.

                            In 2003, Mr. Roth, who had since left the brand he had founded, decided to continue
                            watchmaking under a new brand, Jean
                            Daniel Nicolas, a name made up of his, his wife’s and his son’s names. His company is a
                            classic independent watchmaking
                            workshop where he produces watches – tourbillons with a rotation time of two minutes, which
                            he designs himself without
                            using a computerized design system. The watches are mostly made by hand, of course with the
                            help of his wife and son.
                            Production is limited to a few pieces per year and they are only available in two basic
                            designs. The first is a classic
                            round model, the Tourbillon 2 Minutes Rond, while the second, the Tourbillon 2 Minutes Long,
                            has an unusual
                            violin-shaped case.

                            MH is the largest corporation in the luxury industry, so it is not surprising that its
                            relaunch of the Daniel Roth brand
                            is of interest. In 2010, Bulgari discontinued the Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta brands and
                            continued to produce some of
                            the most successful Daniel Roth designs under its own brand name for around five years. In
                            the meantime, Bulgari and
                            LVMH merged in 2011, which is why the dormant Daniel Roth brand was transferred to LVMH’s
                            portfolio along with another
                            “sleeping beauty”, the Gérald Genta brand. In 2019, when Bulgari was in danger of losing the
                            rights to the Gérald Genta
                            brand, the company resumed production of the watches. Nevertheless, in 2023, LVMH announced
                            the relaunch of the Gérald
                            Genta brand, this time under the LVMH umbrella and literally from scratch. At the beginning
                            of 2024, history repeated
                            itself, this time with Daniel Roth. Among other things, this meant that all previous
                            technical developments of both
                            brands, including the grandiose Grande Sonnerie, remained the property of Bulgari.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The operator of the relaunch of both brands was commissioned by La Fabrique du Temps, Louis
                            Vuitton’s complications
                            manufacture, which belongs to LVMH. The technical side of the projects is led by the
                            founders of La Fabrique du Temps
                            (previously founders of another complication manufacture, BNB Concept), master watchmakers
                            Michel Navas and Enrico
                            Barbasini. LVMH obviously regards the relaunch of the two brands as a politically important
                            project and therefore
                            intends to make considerable investments. This is already evident in the brands’ initial
                            actions. For Daniel Roth, the
                            year 2024 began with the announcement of the relaunch of the brand and the presentation of
                            the Tourbillon Souscription,
                            its first limited edition of 20 pieces. This watch is a reissue of the original Tourbillon
                            Single Face Ref. 186, but
                            from a technical point of view it is a completely new development. Note that the Tourbillon
                            Souscription is a
                            single-dial watch, so the mention of the Ref. 187, which appears in several publications in
                            this context, is not
                            correct.

                        The power reserve of 80 hours is optimal and meets the modern unwritten standard for mechanical
                        luxury watches. The
                        DR001 caliber is based on the same architecture as the FBN 916.01 caliber, which was developed
                        for Laurent Ferrier in
                        2010, and is finished to a very high standard. This is evident in many details, such as the
                        elongated click of the
                        mainspring barrel, a LeCoultre invention from the late 19th century, the black polish of the
                        intermediate wheel bridge
                        and the four gold chatons. Unfortunately, the movement is concealed under a solid caseback, so
                        the owner does not get to
                        enjoy these rare features, as well as the Côtes de Genève, the perlage and (hopefully) the
                        correctly polished screw
                        heads. Judging by the available photo, the movement has a rather technical style that is a far
                        cry from the most elegant
                        examples of pocket calibers from the Vallée de Joux. But the style of Michel Navas and Enrico
                        Barbasini has never been
                        characterized by the pursuit of elegance and harmony – this was already true of their
                        developments in the BNB Concept.

                        The changes to the case design seem quite sensible, the solid gold dial with Clous de Paris (not
                        Ligné!) guilloché is
                        reportedly made in Kari Voutilainen’s workshop, which promises very good results. The prototype
                        presented by the brand
                        has a rather rough print on the dial, which has been criticized in some publications such as
                        watchesbysjx.com, but there
                        is reason to believe that this will be corrected on the finished watch. It will also be
                        interesting to see if the new
                        version of the old logo I mentioned earlier will be corrected. Reportedly, the subscription sold
                        out at the announced
                        price of CHF 140,000 (plus tax), which doesn’t seem excessive – a good sign for a newly launched
                        brand.
