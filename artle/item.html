            <h3>
                ABOUT THIS WATCH </h3>
            <p>
                The present example is an extremely rare, spectacular and fine <b>métiers d’art </b>rose-gold <b>second
                    time zone</b> wristwatch. It was produced in 2016 in a <b>limited edition of 5 pieces</b> for
                William and Son, at that time a Laurent Ferrier retail agent in London. The same design with a case in
                platinum 950 launched the same year, also as a limited edition of 5 pieces. Both are among the brand’s
                rarest watches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laurent Ferrier launched the Galet Classic Traveler collection with a second time zone indicator in
                2013, equipping it with a sophisticated version of the in-house micro-rotor self-winding caliber. The
                Galet Classic Traveler retains the DNA of Laurent Ferrier’s inaugural Galet Double Spiral Tourbillon
                models. The shape of the Galet watch case is fully consistent with the English translation of this term,
                i.e., ‘<b>pebble</b>’, which means all components are <b>smoothly rounded</b>. This reflects the
                aesthetics of a classic hunting pocket watch. In particular, instead of using of a screwed caseback, the
                Galet watch is equipped with a press-fitted (snap-on) caseback, and to facilitate the opening of the
                case, there is a characteristic ‘lip’ on the rim of the caseback at the bottom, which further enhances
                the relationship between the design of Galet and the design of pocket watches. The case of the Galet
                watch is so carefully polished that the <b>smooth, streamlined outlines </b>are really emphasised. For
                this reason, the feeling of the watch on the wrist is very comfortable. Galet watches, including the
                present Galet Traveller, are among the most emotionally attractive watches of the small brands of today
                which specialize in the release of collector’s models. In this regard, Laurent Ferrier occupy one of the
                leading positions.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
                A discreet design of the Laurent Ferrier Galet watch’s <b>caseback with a sapphire crystal</b> and a
                smooth polished rim, which usually lacks inscriptions and emblems, is one of the hallmarks of
                respectable luxury watches of Geneva origin. All technical information is as a rule placed as engraved
                and gilded inscriptions on the bridges of the caliber and as hallmarks on the back of the lugs. Laurent
                Ferrier follows this tradition, rarely allowing itself to deviate from it. This was, however, done as an
                exception in this special edition, with a William and Son logo engraved on the rim of the caseback.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ‘William &amp; Son’ Edition has a métiers d’art dial with an artistic convex map of the world, which
                is made in blue tones using the champlevé fire enamel technique on a plate of 18k white gold. The
                artist, in an effort to create an unusual attractive image, has painted the night lights of each region,
                and used <b>gold-leaf to highlight the United Kingdom’s </b>position on a globe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shape and finishing of the case are matched by a graceful, yet rather large and easy-to-use
                <b>turban-shaped crown</b>. The pin buckle follows the curve of the case, while the elongated markers
                and hands of the modified ‘<b>spade &amp; whip’ style</b>, which are given soft streamlined shapes, give
                the watch a special charm and recognition. Hands of this design are best paired with a polished finish,
                which is what is most often done in the collection, including this watch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another attractive feature of this watch is the <b>two pushers</b> on the left-hand side of the case,
                shaped as traditional <b>sliding switchers</b> of a grande sonnerie pocket watch. Here they allow the
                hour hand to be adjusted forwards or backwards in one-hour increments. The date indicator is tied to a
                travel time, indicated by the central hour and minute hands, it is very convenient for the traveling
                owner of a watch.
            </p>

            <h3>
                MOVEMENT </h3>
            <p>
                The present watch features the <b>self-winding micro-rotor </b>caliber LF 230.1. It was <b>designed and
                    launched in 2013</b> as a dual-time complication version of the basic FBN 229.01 micro-rotor
                caliber.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from the design with bridges and layout that is reminiscent of tourbillon chronometric calibers of
                the mid-20th century, the caliber LF 230.1 features an extremely <b>rare type of escapement </b>with
                double direct impulse transmission. This is very efficient, so that a single barrel is enough for a
                <b>three-day power reserve</b>. The prototype of such an escapement is the famous échappement naturel of
                Abraham-Louis Breguet, invented by him in 1789, which is implemented with state-of-the-art technologies
                using LIGA (nickel-phosphorous impulse wheels) and silicon DRIE (switching pallet-lever part).

            <p>
                The self-winding system uses a heavy <b>18k gold micro-rotor</b> of unidirectional operation with a
                ratchet, and is mounted under the bridge on two ruby jewels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The quality of the finish of the caliber can be described as very high and performed in the classic
                Genevan tradition. The outer surface of the bridges is <b>decorated with a Côtes de Genève</b>,
                vertically oriented and very sharply executed. The mainplate reveals perlage decoration, while the
                chamfers are <b>bevelled and mirror polished</b> with careful finishing of external and internal
                corners, which is a desirable high-end finish but often neglected by many other brands. The slots for
                screws, pins and jewels are <b>chamfered and polished</b> as well. The outer surfaces of the steel
                parts, including the screw heads, pawl, balance cock and micro-rotor bridge, are mirror-polished by
                hand. The inscriptions are engraved and gilded, and the micro-rotor is decorated with grain d’orge
                guilloché.

            <h3>Brand story</h3>
            <p>
                The core of the 1941 Remontoire is the movement. From a technical perspective, it features an eight
                second remontoire, which serves to deliver a constant amount of power to the escapement using a
                secondary wheel, visible through the dial at 9 o’clock. Consisting of 258 individual components, the
                caliber features over a dozen different finishing techniques, from snailing to frosting. The bridges,
                shaped like the bell gable roofs of Dutch houses, are fashioned out of steel, which is much more
                difficult and costly to work with, than brass or silver. <br><br>
                Each individual bridge requires dozens of steps and up to ten hours of work, including mirror polishing
                of the screws, and chamfering rims and slots, demonstrating the brothers’ fascination with depth and
                light. The level of painstaking craftsmanship of the Remontoire movements is striking, and the movement
                is limited to only 188 pieces in total. <br><br>
                The case, measuring 39.5mm across and just 10.5mm thick, is made out of a 5N red gold alloy, known for
                its colour intensity and hardness. Its sculpted profile is executed with a specially shaped cutter, to
                create its characteristic hollowed, concave recesses and convex surfaces. <br><br>
                Different styles of finishing are featured throughout the three-level solid silver dial, which has the
                remontoire exposed at 9 o’clock. Every 8 seconds, the remontoire quickly spins and stops, delivering
                energy to the escapement. Every 8 seconds, the remontoire quickly spins and stops, delivering energy to
                the escapement. <br><br>
                This Grönefeld 1941 Remontoire is accompanied by its original box and paperwork. It comes on our Tokyo
                grey grained leather strap, and also comes with its original alligator strap and Grönefeld red gold
                buckle. <br><br>
                Viewings can be arranged in Central London by appointment.
