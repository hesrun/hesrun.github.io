            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                The Grönefeld 1941 Remontoire, in many ways, is the embodiment of artisanal, independent watchmaking.
                Designed by the Grönefeld brothers in the Netherlands, they took inspiration from a remontoire clock
                their grandfather (and father), used to maintain. The result is esoteric, uncompromising in quality and
                steeped in romanticism. <br><br>
                The Grönefeld brothers’ upbringing in a small town in the Eastern part of the Netherlands was permeated
                in horology. In the evenings and on the weekends, as children, they used to play in their grandfather
                Johan's workshop, surrounded by instruments and by the sound of their ceaseless ticking. As a gifted
                watchmaker, Johan also looked after the clock of the nearby church, dating back to 1240. On his death,
                this custodianship was passed onto his son, the Grönefeld brothers’ father. The latter's year of birth
                was commemorated in the reference of the '1941 Remontoire'.<br><br>
                Watchmaking having made a strong imprint on them in their respective youths, Bart and Tim Grönefeld both
                trained in horology, cutting their teeth at famed complications specialist Renaud et Papi, alongside
                notable contemporaries such as Stephen Forsey and Stepan Sarpaneva. Producing no more than 70 watches a
                year, the Grönefeld brothers create extremely high-quality pieces, having commanded the admiration and
                respect of none other than M. Philippe Dufour, amongst others.

                    <h3>Mechanism</h3>
                    <p>
                        The inspiration for the 1941 Remontoire harkens back to the brothers’ childhood, and the memories of the clock their grandfather and father used to maintain, which featured a seldom-seen, and highly technical form of power distribution: a remontoire. Providing a more constant delivery of energy to the escapement, a remontoire in theory offers greater precision. Celebrated watchmaker Dr. George Daniels, describes the complication thusly,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "The use of the remontoire is by far the best method of smoothing the power supply, but it is complex and costly to make. For this reason watches with remontoires are very rare, and this, combined with their attractive action, gives them a special place in the affections of the connoisseur of mechanics. The fact that the mechanism is quite unnecessary merely adds to its charm."

            <h3>Brand story</h3>
            <p>
                The core of the 1941 Remontoire is the movement. From a technical perspective, it features an eight
                second remontoire, which serves to deliver a constant amount of power to the escapement using a
                secondary wheel, visible through the dial at 9 o’clock. Consisting of 258 individual components, the
                caliber features over a dozen different finishing techniques, from snailing to frosting. The bridges,
                shaped like the bell gable roofs of Dutch houses, are fashioned out of steel, which is much more
                difficult and costly to work with, than brass or silver. <br><br>
                Each individual bridge requires dozens of steps and up to ten hours of work, including mirror polishing
                of the screws, and chamfering rims and slots, demonstrating the brothers’ fascination with depth and
                light. The level of painstaking craftsmanship of the Remontoire movements is striking, and the movement
                is limited to only 188 pieces in total. <br><br>
                The case, measuring 39.5mm across and just 10.5mm thick, is made out of a 5N red gold alloy, known for
                its colour intensity and hardness. Its sculpted profile is executed with a specially shaped cutter, to
                create its characteristic hollowed, concave recesses and convex surfaces. <br><br>
                Different styles of finishing are featured throughout the three-level solid silver dial, which has the
                remontoire exposed at 9 o’clock. Every 8 seconds, the remontoire quickly spins and stops, delivering
                energy to the escapement. Every 8 seconds, the remontoire quickly spins and stops, delivering energy to
                the escapement. <br><br>
                This Grönefeld 1941 Remontoire is accompanied by its original box and paperwork. It comes on our Tokyo
                grey grained leather strap, and also comes with its original alligator strap and Grönefeld red gold
                buckle. <br><br>
                Viewings can be arranged in Central London by appointment.
