                        extravagant self-winding pocket watch. At that time, only a few leading brands produced watches
                        of such a level of complexity as Ref. 3430.&nbsp;

                    <p>
                        Ref. 3737 was released as a <b>modification of the reference 3430</b> from the Souscription set,
                        albeit in much smaller numbers. Antiquorum estimates the circulation of the present reference to
                        be only 5 examples. The extremely small production of Ref. 3737 is indirectly supported by the
                        fact that, to our knowledge, this reference has <b>only come up at auction once</b>, at
                        Antiquorum in Geneva in 1999. We estimate that this model was produced approximately from 1994
                        to 1996.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technically, it is almost the same model as the wristwatch <b>presented in the Souscription
                            set.</b> Ref. 3430 from the Souscription set features a combined month and leap year
                        single-hand indicator for a 48-month cycle at 12 oâclock, while the present model has two hands
                        in a sub-dial at 12 oâclock â one for the 12-month indicator, and one for the leap year
                        indicator. Both references are powered by the same <b>hand-wound minute-repeater caliber
                            567</b>, produced for the brand by the <b>Nouvelle LÃ©mania</b> movement-blanks factory.
                        Evidently, it was developed <b>on the basis of classic pocket watch </b>calibers from the
                        VallÃ©e-de-Joux, in a characteristic design with three straight bridges. It is the so-called
                        âthree-fingerâ wheel-train bridge caliber.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        The sophistication and rarity of the mechanical functions of the minute repeater and perpetual
                        calendar is complemented in this example by the classic artisanal Breguet guillochÃ© dial, as
                        well as the traditional finishing of the caliber
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The finish of caliber 567 is <b>upscale traditional,</b> with CÃ´te de GenÃ¨ve on the bridges,
                        perlage on the mainplate, chamfered and polished bevels, extremely difficult to finish sharp
                        inner and outer corners, engraved and gilded inscriptions, and flat polished steel parts â
                        including two <b>black-polished repeater hammers.</b> The flat spring ratchet of the barrel
                        wheel should also be noted, something found extremely rarely in modern wristwatches and
                        extremely highly appreciated by connoisseurs. The dial of the present example is of typical
                        Breguet style. The <b>silver-plated solid gold dial</b> is decorated with guillochÃ© of three
                        motifs. The chapter ring and sub-dialsâ rims are circularly brushed, with black pad-printed
                        scales, inscriptions and Roman numerals complemented by <b>blued steel âpomme de Breguetâ</b>
                        and countersâ hands. The <b>yellow gold Empire style case</b> completes the picture, creating a
                        coherent image of Breguetâs high-end, super-complex wristwatch.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                        Reasons to bid&nbsp; </h3>
                    <p>
                        According to our knowledge only one example of this <b>highly complicated minute repeating</b>
                        wristwatch has appeared at auction, so the present lot affords collectors the opportunity to
                        acquire <b>one of the rarest wristwatches</b>, embedded with classic high complications of
                        Breguetâs modern production. The RÃ©pÃ©tition Minutes QuantiÃ¨me PerpÃ©tuel Ref. 3737BA is an
                        <b>extremely rare, charismatic and exquisite </b>watch from a world-famous traditional watch
                        brand, one of the undoubted leaders in the haute horlogerie watch market. The sophistication and
                        rarity of the mechanical functions of the minute repeater, the <b>highest of the four
                            traditional complications,</b> and perpetual calendar, combining mechanical sophistication
                        with a practical use, is complemented in this example by the classic artisanal Breguet guillochÃ©
                        dial, as well as the traditional finishing of the caliber, which significantly increase the
                        perceived value of the watch and underscore the aesthetic character of this model, endowed with
                        the finest signs of the <b>famous Breguet style.&nbsp;</b>

                    at the auction house, or by phone or online by clicking the relevant link on the auction overview
                    page.</p>
                <p>The most convenient way to bid at an auction is to place a maximum bid. Just enter the maximum amount
                    youâre willing to pay for the lot, and Ineichen.com will take care of the bidding from there.
                    Absentee bids, which enable you to set your maximum bid on a lot, are executed on your behalf by the
                    auctioneer ahead of the auction, in a similar way as traditional absentee bids.</p>
                <p>After you have registered for the auction, youâre ready to bid live. Log into your account on
                    Ineichen.com first and at the started date and time youâll be able to see and hear the auction
                    taking place via live video feed from the auction room. Youâll be able to participate by bidding in
                    the saleroom, by phone, or online via Ineichen.com or the Ineichen app. </p>
                <p>A live auction begins as the auctioneer opens each lot for bidding. Each lot being sold is shown on
                    the screen together with level of bidding displayed beside it. When the lot you want to bid on is
                    coming up, start bidding. We accept the bids in the order we receive them, and the highest bid
                    placed wins each lot. So even if you placed the leading maximum bid before the auction, please note
                    that another client can outbid you during the live auction.</p>
                <h2>AUCTION GLOSSARY</h2>
                <h5>Absentee Bid </h5>
                <p>If youâre not able to participate in an auction yourself, you can still bid on an item by placing an
                    absentee bid with the auctioneer before an auction begins. During the live auction the auctioneer
                    will execute your absentee bid on your behalf and if there are clients who would like to increase,
                    the auctioneer is going to keep adding bids until they reach the limit you have set. You win the
                    item if the auction ends under your amount, but if other clients outbid you, you have lost the
                    auction. We will notify the successful absentee bidders after the auction.</p>
                <h5>Maximum Bid</h5>
                <p>Instead of incrementally bid in a live auction, you can use the maximum bid feature, which represents
                    the absolute highest price you are willing to pay for a lot. Ineichen will execute bids on your
                    behalf by placing the lowest bid necessary and never going higher than your maximum bid. </p>
                <p>Our bidding platform will automatically execute incremental bids on your behalf beginning at the
                    lowest increment, without going higher than your maximum bid. If you get outbid by another client
                    youâll be notified via email or push notifications so you could increase your bid. </p>
                <p>If two different bidders enter the same maximum bid, we will prioritize the bid which was entered
                    first.</p>
                <p>If you wish to place an absentee bid, the auctioneer will execute your maximum bid on your behalf and
                    if your bid wins, youâll be notified after the auction. You are free to increase your maximum before
                    the live auction starts.</p>
                <h5>Starting Bid</h5>
                <p>Also know known as âopening bidâ, it represents the lowest possible price you may place on a lot, and
                    itâs the price at which the bidding starts. Clients are allowed to bid at or above the starting bid.
                    Also, you can place a bid which is lower than the reserve price, but the item can be sold only when
                    you meet or exceed the reserve price. We will notify you if you become a leading bidder or if you
                    have been outbid. </p>
                <h5>Quick Bid</h5>
                <p>Quick Bid feature allows you to increase your bid to the next increment in a fraction of a second.
                    Just click the âQuick Bidâ to confirm your bid increase on Ineichen.com, and your bid will be
                    placed. This feature is available in online only auctions. </p>
                <h5>My Active Bids</h5>
                <p>In this section you can browse all your current bids and their status: active, won and lost bids
                    marked with corresponding colors. </p>
